# Immersive Vehicles Development Toolkit
 IVDT is a software toolkit intended to make Immersive Vehicles pack creation easier. This software is in VERY EARLY development and has yet to really branch into areas of significance within IV pack creation.

Features:
- Pack Creation
- Creative Tab Managment
- Adding Fonts
- In Dev Texture Editor (Currently laggy)

Planned:
- Adding of all Immersive Vehicles item types
- Immersive Railroading pack converter
- 3D model viewer (Might add simple editing functions down the road)
